        Entry 10/1/2024: <br>
          I have begun the production of my website. It looks sucky, and the
      text on this file probably will not be visible or navigatable for a while. Here's to
      the first foot forward.
      <br>
      Ok nvm, I got it to move, and have multiple pages, but it looks sucky

          So, I decided to do it a little differet. I came to the conclution that this would be a truly
          miserable process to develop my own website style and layout in raw html. Thus, taking this into
          account, I set up 2 other websites. The first one is one of rust, just because i want to eventually
          set the entire thing up with just rust. The second one was a react/node.js website. Right now, it 
          has nothing on it, but im using it to develop a color theme, some basic jumpstarting for my own css
          page, and other front end design work. The content will stay here, but that will be my experimental
          playground where its not extremely time intensive. <br><br>
          Also I got this thing set up in a git repo, so thats cool. The things now living in git ig, so itll be
          easier when i want to set it up officially. I also updated this thing a bit, and set up an ordering
          system so my diary posts are more...managable for the future.
